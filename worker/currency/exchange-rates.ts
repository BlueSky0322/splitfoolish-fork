// Exchange rates for converting items into a split's currency: Wise's live mid-market
// rate (when a token is set) and the ECB's daily rate from Frankfurter (free, no key),

// services a few requests per pair, and a day-old rate still serves if both are down.

// Items are converted at the rate on the day they were paid (getRateOn): today's live
// rate, or for an earlier day the ECB's rate for it, then Wise's.
